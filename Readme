## 1. Design Import

The Physical Design flow starts by importing the synthesized gate-level netlist and timing constraints into ICC2.

Activities performed:
- Read gate-level netlist generated from Design Compiler  
- Read SDC timing constraints  
- Load technology files and standard cell libraries  
- Create design database (NDM)  
- Perform initial design checks  

Checks performed:
- Unconnected ports check  
- Missing library cell check  
- Unresolved reference check  

Goal:
Ensure clean design database before floorplanning.
